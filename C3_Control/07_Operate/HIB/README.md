Secure storage: Secure storage for devices in SCRATCh IoT deployments. Using two different levels of security for files required in the Police use case (small text files containing suspect facial profiles, logs and detection in frames). Secure storage will be provided in two profiles: (a) baseline regular encryption service using off-the-shelf methods (e.g., RSA) and shared keys and (b) usage of Trusted Execution Environments in devices that support it such as ARM Trustzone.
