The Firmware Update System offers a comprehensive analysis of security threats and requirements to be considered when deploying updates to IoT end devices, and proposes a system architecture especially for handling such deployment in a situation with varied end devices from multiple vendors. In its current state, the Firmware Update System is a framework rather than a specific implementation, as it is very much necessary to adapt to contextual limitations and needs.

The documentation consists of three major parts. The first part is an analysis of existing knowledge and frameworks. The second part is a recombination of security threats, and the security requirements proposed for addressing these threats, as found in the existing works. The resulting lists have been carefully curated to create the best possible resulting lists of issues and solutions within the specific field of IoT update deployment. Many of these solutions depend on the implementation and handling of "Manifests" which include important metadata, and which are signed together with the update binaries themselves.

The third part details the system architecture that can be used to make deployment and monitoring for various end devices more comprehensive and accessible. It will allow clients to formulate concise demands and implement simple measures in order to ensure the security of their deployment system.
