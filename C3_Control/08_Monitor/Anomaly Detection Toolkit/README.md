Anomaly Detection Toolkit: Detecting deviations from self-learned behavioural system models and deriving attacks from it. Will be integrated into an IoT-environment and detect anomalous and thus suspicious behaviour. Relevant parameters are extracted from the environment and automatically compared with the normal system model in real-time to discover deviations.
