# Irdeto Trusted Software
## Introduction
Irdeto [Trusted Software] is a code protection service that can be accessed online or via a Web API. It is used to harden applications that run on iOS and Android devices against attacks and reverse engineering. Trusted Software uses ML to identify security sensative code within the app and automatically applies code obfuscation to protect relevant sensative code. Trusted Software is based on Irdeto's industry leading software protection toolset, [Cloakware Software Protection].

## Software Hacking is a Business
* Criminals offer many products and services built on top of hacked software
* The average IoT device is attacked 5,233 times each month
* Compromised IoT devices are a prime target for hackers
  * Botnet armies can be used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
  * IoT devices in critical infrastructure can be ransomed
  * IoT devices can be used to distribute malware
* Hackers use dynamic and static methods to attack IoT devices
  * Reverse engineer code to find vulnerabilities
  * Alter code to support hacker‘s objectives
  * Probe running code to extract secrets (crypto-keys)

## Value of Code Obfuscation
* Makes reverse engineering more difficult
  * Prevents use of debugging tools
  * Protects against system call hooking
  * Stops code from running on rooted devices
* Hides keys and secrets in software or storage
  * Protects application / business logic
  * Protects valuable IP in code
  * Protects keys, both stored and when used
* Prevents hacking / changes to software
* Enables software diversity
  * Software instances are functionally equivalent, but code differs
  * Reduces scale of an attack, and resets hacker progress

## Simplifying Code Obfuscation
* “Good” code obfuscation is an art
  * Must master multiple tools with steep learning curves
  * Requires software, security, and crypto skills
  * Time consuming to fine-tune performance vs footprint
* Makes sense for security-critical and complex software
* Less feasible for simpler IoT software and Apps
* Irdeto Trusted Software
  * On-line service that automatically applies code obfuscation
  * Uses AI to identify security-sensitive code in Apps
* Applies security using Cloakware® Software Protection
* Beyond SotA: Trusted Software is the first (and currently only) obfuscation tool that makes use of machine learning to automatically apply protection to code
