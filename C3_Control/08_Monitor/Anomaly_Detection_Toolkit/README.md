Anomaly Detection Toolkit: Detecting deviations from self-learned behavioural system models and deriving attacks from it. Will be integrated into an IoT-environment and detect anomalous and thus suspicious behaviour. Relevant parameters are extracted from the environment and automatically compared with the normal system model in real-time to discover deviations.

The use of information technology and the associated computer networks is growing globally in all kinds of fields, such as industry, medicine, the service sector and in the private sphere of human life. This creates the difficult problem of making networks secure from malicious attacks. To do this, attackers are using increasingly sophisticated new tools and techniques to find new vulnerabilities in the network and its systems, which makes it very difficult to detect all attacks and attack opportunities in the system. One way to monitor a network is to use so called Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). They can appear in different forms, e.g. by monitoring the network traffic or using other side channels to detect attacks. In general, there are two types of IDS:
-	Anomaly-based IDS: Works with previously recorded data to learn normal behavior. By comparing the behavior of the previously recorded data with the real-time data, it is able to detect new attacks. The disadvantage of this system is that it has a high false positive rate and when changes occur in the system, the system must be adapted to it.
-	Misused-based IDS: Works with a repository of attack signatures it ensures no false alarms are generated. However, new attacks with corresponding new attack signatures cannot be detected. It is important to keep this attack signatures database up to date.

Regarding to Intrusion Detection is a classification problem with possible categories such as normal or (a particular kind of) intrusion and as such it can be implemented by various machine learning algorithms. In general there are two kinds of machine learning algorithms. One is called supervised learning, where the prerecorded data is already labeled and the corresponding algorithms needs to distinguish between the data with corresponding label. The other technique is unsupervised learning where the data do not contain labels and algorithms labels the data by them self.
Several machine learning algorithms have been used for supervised anomaly based IDS e.g. Neural networks such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)  or Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Trees such as Random Forests , k-means clustering  or Support Vector Machines .
