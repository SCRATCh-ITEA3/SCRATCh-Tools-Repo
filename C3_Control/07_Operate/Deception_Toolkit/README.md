Deception Toolkits: The purpose of this tool is to impede the reconnaissance phase of an attacker. According to the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain, this phase is the first in a series of hostile activities. A directed manipulation of the hostile reconnaissance output therefore affects the entire process of hostile activity. Ideally, deception allows immediate impact on the prevention of an attack.
