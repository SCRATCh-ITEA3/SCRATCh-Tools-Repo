[OWASP Dependency Track] checks vulnerability, license, and quality risks in a real-time software bill of materials. Dependency-Track is an intelligent Supply Chain Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk from the use of third-party and open source components. Dependency-Track takes a unique and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). This approach provides capabilities that traditional Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve.
